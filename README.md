Implementing RNNs in TensorFlow by hand

**1 - [simple sequence-to-sequence model with dynamic unrolling](1-seq2seq.ipynb)**
> Deliberately slow-moving, explicit tutorial. I tried to thoroughly explain everything that I found in any way confusing.

> Implements simple seq2seq model described in [Sutskever at al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) and tests it against toy memorization task.

More to follow.
